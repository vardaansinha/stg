## JVNS News: Agile Manifesto

As a team, we will ensure that our communication is on point; we must talk to each other regarding all of our tasks and pushes to our news site, and this will help us make the best product possible. As a team, we will ensure that we have a WORKING news site that can be pushed out to consumers of daily news. As a team, we will make sure that if there are any errors with our site, we will not only communicate amongst ourselves, but we will also communicate with the consumers to get feedback on our site. Finally, as a team, we will make sure that we are all open-minded in regards to change, and we will accept each other's ideas and consumers' ideas to make the best news site possible.
